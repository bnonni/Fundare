# How to Install Flutter (Mac)

1. Install dependencies for [Mac](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/macos) 
   * Ruby => Pre-installed on Mac
        - Open a terminal program, and run:
         ```
         which ruby
         ```
        - If you get a similar output, you're good to go!
         ```sh
         computer-name:~ username$ ruby -v
         ruby 2.3.7p456 (2018-03-28 revision 63024) [universal.x86_64-darwin18]
         ```
   
   * [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) => Open terminal, and run:
        ```sh
        sudo ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
        ```
      - Ensure you have full admin access to your computer (if you don't know for sure that you do, you probably don't). 
      - To enable/check this, go [here](http://osxdaily.com/2016/11/01/convert-user-to-admin-account-command-line-mac/).
   
   * [bash](https://www.github.com/bnonni/UNIX) => Open terminal, and run:
        ```sh
        brew install bash
        ```
   
   * [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/) => Open terminal, and run:
        ```sh
        brew install curl
        ```
   
   * [git 2.x](https://gist.github.com/derhuerst/1b15ff4652a867391f03#file-mac-md) => In terminal, and run:
        ```sh
        brew install git
        ```
   
   * [CocoaPods](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html) => In terminal, and run:
        ```sh
        sudo gem install cocoapods
        ```
      - Then, visit the CocoaPods link above, and follow the instructions closely. 
   
   * [Xcode Developer Tools](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
      - Open terminal, and run:
        ```sh
        xcode-select --install
        ```

   ```
   Paste this line into your .bash_profile
    ```
    export PATH="$PATH:~/flutter/bin"
    ```
 5. Ensure you're in the ~/ directory (or wherever you unzipped flutter), and run:
   ```
    flutter precache
   ```
